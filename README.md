# Cellular Automata Simulation with SFML

![Cell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txcmosquito/CellularAutomata/master/SS/Cell.png)

This project is a Cellular Automata simulation implemented using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). It features an interactive grid where cells evolve based on predefined rules.

## Features

- **Cellular Automata Rules:** The simulation follows rules that determine the state of each cell based on its neighbors.
- **Interactive Grid:** Users can interact with the grid by clicking on cells to toggle their state.
- **Zoom and Drag:** The simulation supports zooming in and out, as well as dragging to navigate the grid.
- **Visual Appeal:** The project uses a visually appealing color scheme to enhance the user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have SFML installed on your system.

### Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/txcmosquito/CellularAutomata.git
    cd CellularAutomata
    ```

2. Build the project using Visual Studio 2022.


## Controls

- **Left Mouse Button:** Click to toggle the state of cells.
- **Middle Mouse Button:** Hold and drag to pan the grid.
- **Mouse Wheel:** Scroll up/down to zoom in/out.
- **Close Window:** Press the close button to exit the application.
